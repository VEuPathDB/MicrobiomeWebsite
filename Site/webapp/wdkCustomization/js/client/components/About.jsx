      <h1>About MicrobiomeDB</h1>

      <h2 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          High-throughput sequencing has revolutionized microbiology by allowing scientists to complement culture-based approaches with culture-independent profiling of complex microbial communities.  Whether studying these communities in soil, on plants, or in animals, the collection of community composition data is often accompanied with rich metadata that describes the source from which the sample was derived, how samples were treated prior to collection, and how they were processed after collection.  Increasingly, the goal of microbiome experiments is to understand how these various attributes represented by the metadata, influence the microbial community.  MicrobiomeDB was developed as a discovery tool that empowers researchers to fully leverage their experimental metadata to construct queries that interrogate microbiome datasets.

        <p>MicrobiomeDB uses an automated pipeline for loading raw fastq files from microbiome experiments carried out on the Illumina or 454 'pyrosequencing' platforms.  Raw sequences from each study are processed using <a href="https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/">DADA2</a> and the <a href="http://greengenes.secondgenome.com/">Greengenes reference database</a> of 16S rDNA sequences</p>

        <p>In addition to loading taxonomic data, MicrobiomeDB loads all 'metadata' terms used by the experimenter to describe each sample.  These terms are mapped to the MIxS ontology and unmapped terms are manually curated and used to expand a custom, MIxS-compliant, ontology tree.  This rich, structured sample description generates an <a href="http://isa-tools.org/">ISA.tab</a> file that is then loaded into microbiomeDB.  When combined with the extensive web toolkit and infrastructure developed by <a href="http://eupathdb.org">EuPathDB</a>, the user is provided with an web interface to interrogate complex, even massive-scale, microbiome studies using metadata queries.  The resulting queries are then visualized using a suite of <a href="http://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny apps</a> available directly in the browser.</p>

        <p>Although the datasets currently loaded in the site are from 16S rDNA marker gene sequencing, we are working on adding functionality for handling 'shotgun' metagenomic sequence data, potentially allowing interrogation of community composition at the species or strain level, looking at other organisms in complex communities (e.g. fungi and prokaryotes), as well as identification of samples based on the relative abundance of bacterial genes (e.g. antibiotic resistance, virulence factors, etc.).  Taken together, we hope to develop a full-featured, open-source platform for a systems biology view of microbial communities.</p>

        <p>
          The best way to learn about the site is by watching the tutorials on our <a href="https://vimeo.com/album/5598563">Vimeo page</a>.

        <p>
          Not yet.  However, you can reach out to the microbiomeDB team at the 'Contact Us' link on the homepage to inquire about getting your own published data loaded into the site.  We are working on developing private workspaces that would allow users upload their own data, access our tools for filtering, analyzing and visualizing, all while keeping their data private.  Look for this feature in future releases.

      <h2 id="Can-i-access-code-used-for-microbiomeDB">Can I access code used for microbiomeDB?</h2>
      <div>
        <p>Yes!  Our code is maintained using Git, and we welcome input from the community.  Checkout our scripts for each of the <a href="https://github.com/EuPathDB/MicrobiomeWebsite/tree/master/View/lib/R/shiny/apps">Shiny apps</a>.  In addition, you can access the code we use for running DADA2 on our cluster on all samples prior to loading into the site, which consists of the following four scripts:</p>
